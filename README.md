# Internship_Screening_Project

This project was developed for Internship Screening Round.

The front end is developed purely using technologies which are
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. BOOTSTRAP 4

The website is developed keeping web view in focus. This is a static website which is having no animation and transitions.

You can view the website on https://go23rishu.github.io/Internship_Screening_Project/

There are important files in this project:
index.html -> It contains the HTML Code and CDNs to provide structure to website.
style.css -> It contains the CSS code for styling classes in HTML
images folder -> It contains all the media files.

Thank You
